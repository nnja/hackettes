INTRO
-----

This file will give you the necessary information to get
started with creating your hockey team. Please make sure
you read all of it. Should there be any issues, contact
any staff member, we'll be happy to help you.


THE GOAL
--------

You and your team mates will program an ice hockey team
using the API we have given you. After coding finishes,
all the teams will be facing each other in an epic
hockey tournament. Your goal, of course, is to win.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

* A team number.
* A computer.
* Excellent team spirit.
* A Java Development Kit (JDK). JDKs for the most common
  operating systems have been provided on USB sticks provided
  to you.


TRYING OUT THE GAME
-----------------------------------

In the directory where this file resides, do:

> java -jar hockey.jar

It will give you an interface where you can play some 
sample games between teams. Select a team in the left
list, select another one in the right list, and hit play.
Note that only the top teams in the respective lists are
playable. The rest of the teams are to be created during 
this contest, and your next step is to make your team 
playable.


SETTING UP YOUR FIRST TEAM
--------------------------

Now it's time to create and set up the directory for your team.
As you entered the contest, you were given a team number, which
is a number consisting of two digits.

1) In the directory where this file is located, find the directory
named "teamXX". This directory contains a sample implementation of
a hockey team.

2) Rename the directory to match your team number. I.e., if your
team number is 01, you rename the directory to "team01".

3) All the classes in your team directory must belong to a java
package that corresponds to your team name (the directory name).

  3.1) Open Team.java in your team directory.

  3.2) Change the top row from "package teamXX;" to match your team
       number, i.e. if your team number is 01, change this line to
       "package team01;".

4) Now it's time to make your team playable against some of the 
already playable teams. Let's start off with compiling your team.

  4.1) Execute the following command in the directory containing
       this README file:
       
       > javac -classpath .:hockey.jar teamXX/*.java 
         (where XX is your team number)
         
         If you're on windows, use ".;hockey.jar" instead of
         ".:hockey.jar".

5) Now your team should be playable in the game interface. Once
again, start the game interface using: 

> java -jar hockey.jar

and try playing your team number against another already playable
team. If everything is good, the hockey players should start moving
once the game kicks off.


CUSTOMIZING YOUR TEAM
---------------------

A team is created by implementing a class representing the team.
This file is in your team directory, and it is named "Team.java".

1) Open teamXX/Team.java in your favourite editor. 
   (where XX is your team number)

2) Modify the team to match your preferences. Set your team short
name, team name, player colors. 

3) Compile your team again, by standing in the directory containing
this file and doing:

   javac -classpath .:hockey.jar teamXX/*.java 
   (where XX is your team number)
         
   If you're on windows, use ".;hockey.jar" instead of
   ".:hockey.jar".

4) Open the game interface again to see that your changes took
effect.

5) Note the getPlayer(index i) and getGoalie() methods in Team.java. 
Have a look at the other player classes. This is where most of your
player logic will go.


DEVELOPING YOUR TEAM LOGIC
--------------------------

For documentation on the game and how to write your teams, please
see the API documentation, which resides in the docs directory:
 
docs/index.html

We advice you to look at the source code for the other sample 
teams. They reside in the "samples/" directory.
 

TIME TO START CODING
--------------------

Alright, it's time to start developing your team now. In general,
you'll  be fine by reading the documentation (see above) and looking
at the sample code we have provided.

Some other general advice:

* You don't have much time. Start out by making something that
  works. Something that can shoot at the goal. A goalie that
  doesn't fail too hard.

* Remember to test out penalty mode. You can do this in the game
  interface.

* Have fun, lots and lots of fun.




SUBMITTING
----------

The final and most important part, submitting your team. You should
submit a directory that contains the team you have developed, preferably
in a zipped format. The directory should contain all the source code
we need to run your team. As long as you copy all the .java files in
the directory, you should be fine.

Your team has to be submitted to the judges before the contest ends,
and it should be submitted in the way requested by the contest judges.


QUESTIONS
---------

If anything is unclear, contact one of the venue organizers. We'll
be happy to help you!

Good luck, and may the best team win!
